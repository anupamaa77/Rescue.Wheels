                        <h3>Hidden Prevalence of Vehicle Breakdown Issues</h3>
                        <p>
                            While researching online about the prevalence of vehicle-related problems, we found a
                            surprising lack of data and research on the topic. So, our team decided to conduct a small
                            road interview session to gather data. Out of 100 people surveyed, 80 reported having
                            similar issues. It is clear that people are often unaware of how widespread these problems
                            are. Many individuals have to wait for hours or even days to have their vehicles fixed
                            because mechanics need to travel to the location of the breakdown. Despite the presence of
                            many mechanics along highways, vehicle owners often remain unaware of their availability.

                <p>
                    We used Figma to create the initial prototype of our application. Figma's robust features allowed us
                    to design a user-friendly interface and collaborate in real-time. The prototype helped us visualize
                    the app's layout, user flow, and overall design aesthetics before moving on to development.
                    <br> <br> By iterating on our designs in Figma, we were able to refine the user experience and
                    interface elements, making sure every aspect of the app met our high standards for usability and
                    visual appeal..

                <h3>GUI</h3>
                <h2>Tikinter</h2>
                <img src="images/5.png" alt="" width="250px">
                <p>Tkinter is a Python library widely used for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs). It offers
                    simplicity and efficiency, providing developers with a straightforward toolkit for building
                    interactive applications.
                    <br>
                    Tkinter's cross-platform compatibility ensures that applications run seamlessly across different
                    operating systems without requiring any modifications. With its customizable widgets and
                    event-driven programming model, developers can create visually appealing and responsive interfaces
                    tailored to their specific requirements
                    <br>
                    With the assistance of Tkinter, our project underwent a transformation, boasting a flawless GUI that
                    significantly enhanced its usability. Tkinter's intuitive framework enabled us to design an
                    interface that is both visually appealing and effortlessly navigable, contributing to a seamless
                    user experience.

                <h2>Python</h2>
                <img src="images/6.jpeg" alt="" width="250px">
                <p>
                    Python plays a pivotal role in the backend of the Rescue.Wheel system, handling tasks such as data
                    processing, message storage, and integration with external services if needed.

                    <br>
                    Python has played a pivotal role in the creation of our GUI software, serving as the backbone for
                    its development. Python's rich ecosystem, particularly its Tkinter library, provided us with the
                    tools necessary to craft an intuitive and visually appealing user interface.
                    <br>
                    Leveraging Python's simplicity and readability, we were able to rapidly prototype and iterate on
                    various design ideas, ensuring that our GUI software met the needs and preferences of our users.

                    member with a strong aptitude for problem-solving and design. In the "rescue.wheels" project, I
                    played a pivotal role by spearheading the app design and prototyping phases.

                    This involved creating detailed wireframes and interactive prototypes that formed the foundation of
                    our user interface, ensuring an intuitive and user-friendly experience for our end-users.
                    <br>

                    <br>
                    I also authored detailed reports that documented our findings, design decisions, and progress. These
                    reports served as a valuable resource for our team and stakeholders, providing clarity and direction
                    throughout the project lifecycle. In addition, I crafted various diagrams, such as flowcharts and
                    system architecture diagrams, to visually represent our processes and technical implementations,
                    facilitating better understanding and communication within the team.
